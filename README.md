shinyAce
==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/trestletech/shinyAce.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/trestletech/shinyAce)

The `shinyAce` package enables Shiny application developers to use the 
[Ace text editor](https://ace.c9.io/#nav=about) in their applications. All
current modes (languages) and themes are supported in this package. The 
mode, theme, and current text can be defined when the element is initialized 
in `ui.R` or afterwards using the `updateAceEditor()` function. The editor
registers itself as a reactive Shiny input, so the current value of the
editor can easily be pulled from `server.R` using `input$yourEditorsName`.

Installation
------------

shinyAce is available [on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shinyAce), so installation is as simple as:

```
install.packages("shinyAce")
```

You can install the latest development version of the code using the `devtools` R package.

```
# Install devtools, if you haven't already.
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("trestletech/shinyAce")
```

## Getting Started

Various examples are available in the [`inst/examples`](https://github.com/trestletech/shinyAce/tree/master/inst/examples) directory included in the package. A few examples are described below. (Note that the package must be installed before you can run any examples.)

### 01-basic ([Live Demo](https://vnijs.shinyapps.io/shinyAce-01-basic/))

Run example: `shiny::runApp(system.file("examples/01-basic", package="shinyAce"))`

![shinyAce](https://trestletech.github.io/shinyAce/images/shinyAce.png)

Demonstrates the basic capabilities of shinyAce including the ability to set an initial value, or interactively assign a value, theme, or mode later on in the session.

### 02-eval

Run example: `shiny::runApp(system.file("examples/02-eval", package="shinyAce"))`

![shinyAce](https://trestletech.github.io/shinyAce/images/shinyAce-eval.png)

Shows an example of using shinyAce to allow the user to compose R code which will then be evaluated on the server.

### 03-knitr

Run example: `shiny::runApp(system.file("examples/03-knitr", package="shinyAce"))`

![shinyAce](https://trestletech.github.io/shinyAce/images/shinyAce-knitr.png)

Demonstrates integrating shinyAce with the [knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/) package. (Note also that an example of this integration is available [in the knitr package](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/tree/master/inst/shiny) itself and includes features such as R syntax highlighting.)

### 04-shinyui

Run example: `shiny::runApp(system.file("examples/04-shinyui", package="shinyAce"))`

![shinyAce](https://trestletech.github.io/shinyAce/images/shinyAce-renderui.png)

Demonstrates using shinyAce to allow a user to create a Shiny UI within Shiny itself. The UI can then be rendered on the right half of the page. Could be a great learning tool for teaching how to construct Shiny UIs.

### 05-hotkeys ([Live Demo](https://vnijs.shinyapps.io/shinyAce-05-hotkeys/))

Run example: `shiny::runApp(system.file("examples/05-hotkeys", package="shinyAce"))`

An example using the `hotkeys` feature of ShinyAce to allow application developers to expose keyboard shortcuts to their users. 

### 06-autocomplete ([Live Demo](https://vnijs.shinyapps.io/shinyAce-06-autocomplete/))

Run example: `shiny::runApp(system.file("examples/06-autocomplete", package="shinyAce"))`

An example using the `autocomplete` feature of ShinyAce to enable Ace to suggest completions as the user types.

### 07-autocomplete-combine ([Live Demo](https://vnijs.shinyapps.io/shinyAce-07-autocomplete-combine/))

Run example: `shiny::runApp(system.file("examples/07-autocomplete-combine", package="shinyAce"))`

Create a custom (reactive) autocomplete list to use in the editor

### 08-resize ([Live Demo](https://vnijs.shinyapps.io/shinyAce-08-resize/))

Run example: `shiny::runApp(system.file("examples/08-resize", package="shinyAce"))`

Shows how to include an Ace editor that will dynamically adjusting size depending on the provided user input.

### 09-selectionId ([Live Demo](https://vnijs.shinyapps.io/shinyAce-09-selectionId/))

Run example: `shiny::runApp(system.file("examples/09-selectionId", package="shinyAce"))`

Shows how to access the position of the cursor in the editor and any selected text or code.

### 10-modules 

Run example: `shiny::runApp(system.file("examples/10-modules", package="shinyAce"))`

Demonstrates how to use shinyAce with shiny modules.

### 11-code-hotkeys

Run example: `shiny::runApp(system.file("examples/11-code-hotkeys", package="shinyAce"))`

Use hotkeys to evaluate a selection of code or step through your code using hotkeys

### Security Note

As with any online application, it is a **genuinely bad idea** to allow arbitrary users to execute code on your server. The above examples show such an environment in which arbitrary R code is being executed on a remote machine. In a trusted environment (such as after authenticating a user or on a network protected by a firewall), this may not be a terrible idea; on a public server without authentication, it most certainly is. So please use the above examples with caution, realizing that without proper security checks in place, allowing unknown users to execute arbitrary R code would make it trivial for an attacker to compromise your server or steal your private data.
